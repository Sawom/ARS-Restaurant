<h4> About this project: </h4>  <br>
Here is my new full stack MERN project. There two parts in my project. One for user and others for admin.
An user can create account, order food, payment for food, add to cart, order cancel and so on.
An admin can add item, delete item. Also admin has access to delete a user.
Admin and user should be logged in to entire their account. In this case I use firebase to impliment authentication system.
server hosting in railway and client in netlify. then add domain in firebase.
